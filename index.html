                <p>As we transition towards a different epoch in
                    South Africa , it becomes vital to teach young
                    people about society and more importantly
                    the legal pillars that protect and strengthen democracy.
                </p>
                <p>We dare not fail the young because of the
                    current epoch. Children must understand the
                    significance of the democratic dispensation
                    and its significance in shaping society. Why
                    people vote, why people petition, how people must petition. What parliament and the
                    Legislature mean.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The democracy pack is a series of books for children between 7 and 12 to teach about the basic concepts of South African democracy.
